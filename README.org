* Experiment with adding Rails style parameters to Hunchentoot.

** Installation

After cloning the repo run the following in your REPL.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(push #p"/home/user/Programming/Lisp/my-routes/" asdf:*central-registry*)

(ql:quickload :my-routes)
(in-package :my-routes)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then open browser and visit: http://localhost:5000/baz/alice/has/cat.
Routes are defined in my-routes.lisp. To achieve expected behaviour experiment
with defining your own routes creating something like:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/controller/:action/:id
#+END_EXAMPLE

Extracted params are passed as arguments to the handler function.
